# Test Categories

The framework supports different types of tests, such as Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End (E2E) Tests. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- **Integration Tests:** Located in the `src/test/java/com/playwright/practice/tests/integration/` directory. These tests validate how the system components integrate.

- **Unit Tests:** Not included currently, but can be placed under `tests/unit/` for testing individual components or methods.

- **E2E Tests:** Tests that simulate complete workflows can be placed under `tests/e2e/`.
