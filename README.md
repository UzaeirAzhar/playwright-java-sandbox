# Playwright Practice Project

This is a Java-based Playwright Automation Framework designed for UI testing. The framework uses Playwright, JUnit 5, and follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. Itâ€™s designed to be lightweight, extensible, and easy to use. This README provides an overview of the project structure, dependencies, reporting capabilities, and instructions on how to run the tests.
